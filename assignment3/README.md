This file documents how to use the eggGeneratorBash.py script from git bash

1.You need to be running mayapy from git bash, use this command to set it as an alias:
alias mayapy="winpty /C/location/on/machine/of/mayapy.exe"

2. Type mayapy then drag and drop the eggGeneratorBash.py file into the shell beside it (to the right). This will auto-populate the file path.

3. Press enter to run the script

4. You will be prompted to enter the radius of a sphere. 0.5 has the nicest result, but you can type any number greater than or equal to zero

5. Next, you will be asked a vague question about making eggs. Type "y" or "n" to choose if you want to make eggs. If you type "y" or anything other than "n", the sphere you just made will be turned into 34 eggs.

6. After generating the eggs, the script will ask you to input a file path to save the new maya file. Here is an example of an acceptable file path:

"C:/Users/klyns/OneDrive - Drexel University/Desktop/ANIM435/WK03/anim435-2024-krq33/assignment3/bin/eggGenerator.mb"

Make sure to include quotations at the start and end of the file path. Also, don't forget to choose a name for the file and add the file type prefix (.mb or .ma)

7.That's all folks!
