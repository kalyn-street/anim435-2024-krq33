This file documents how to use the eggGeneratorBash.py script from git bash

1.You need to be running mayapy from git bash, use this command to set it as an alias:
alias mayapy="winpty /C/location/on/machine/of/mayapy.exe"

2. Type mayapy then drag and drop the eggGeneratorBash.py file into the shell beside it (to the right). This will auto-populate the file path.

3. Press enter to run the script

4. You will be prompted to enter the radius of a sphere. 0.5 has the nicest result, but you can type any number greater than or equal to zero

5. Next, you will be asked a vague question about making eggs. Type "y" or "n" to choose if you want to make eggs. If you type "y" or anything other than "n", the sphere you just made will be turned into 34 eggs.

6. After generating the eggs, the script will automatically name and save a maya file with the new geometry you just created in anim435-2024-krq33/assignment3/bin. You can open this file to see your beautiful creation.

7.That's all folks!
